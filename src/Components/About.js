        <p className="text">
        Vhager is a community-driven meme project on Solana, featuring a deflationary token model with a 1% buy/sell tax. 
        This tax will be used solely for the subsequent buyback and burning of the $Vhager token, which will explicitly lead to a reduction in token circulation over time. 
        Vhager will prioritize community engagement through regular events. Leveraging the Solana blockchain, the project will ensure transparency and accountability.
